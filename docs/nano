# The Nano Command

## Summary 
Nano is a simple terminal-based text editor. Though not as powerful as Emacs or Vim, it is easy to learn and use. Nano is ideal for making small changes to existing configuration files or for writing short plain text files. It was originally created as a free replacement for the non-free Pico editor. 
## how to use it 

$ To start nano with an empty file, open a terminal window and at the command-line type "nano" (without the quotes) 



## Editing Text

### `-a`
The `-a` flag shows files that are normally hidden by BASH. These are files that begin with a `.` such as [.DS_Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store), [.bashrc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)#Startup_scripts), or .bash_history.

### `-l`
The `-l` flag gives a column view of files and directories. It also gives information about those files and directories including permissions, last date modified and size.

### `-h`
When used the `-l` flag, the `-h` flag displays file size in human-readable units such as kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.
